 # Design choice
- Welcome to the ultimate realm of real death metal festivals, where the lineup members embody the essence of true devils, adorned in the dominating hues of black and red. The font choice complements this concept.

- I've used Bootstrap to create a navbar, hero section, modal window, a lineup gallery, location info, ticket prices, and a footer with animations to keep things lively.
